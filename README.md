# Random-Racers-Using-Java-Threads
Focus: use of threads

### About
* Create four threads that sequentially and respectively represents: **Bugs Bunny (B)**, **Taz Devil (D)**, **Tweety (T)**, and **Marvin the Martian (M)**.
  * Goal: Don't allow threads to collide and synchronize them properly
* Movement of each character is random
* Bunny, Taz, Tweety, and Marvin are trying to win the race in their own thread to take control of the planet
* The board gets printed every time a player moves
* The characters have to locate on golden **carrot/flag (C)** 
  * and then run, carrying the carrot/flag to the **Mountain (F)**
* When someone gets the carrot/flag, the carrot/flag (**C**) will show next to the character: e.g. **B(C)**
* Whoever places the carrot/flag first on the Mountain(F) will win the race
* There will be only 2 golden carrot/flags on the board, which will allow only two runners to try to get to the mountain first
* In the attempt to decrease the chances of others to get to the top of the **Mountain (F)** first, **Marvin** activates the space x multi-dimensional time travel machine to change the location of the mountain randomly every 3 cycles.
* Besides trying to find the carrot/flag (C), Marvin cheats in which he can delete other competitors and is capable of stealing a carrot/flag, if he steps on the same grid where there is another competitor.
  * However, other competitors are not allowed to step on the same grid as others.
* No one can get on the mountain if they don't have a carrot/flag.
